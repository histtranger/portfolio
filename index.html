        <p itemprop="description" class="push-0 white">Somehow you've stumbled upon my portfolio website. I'll be honest, web development isn't my strongest asset, but I have much more to offer and show you. Photography is something I really love and it's one of my favorite past times. And for some reason I enjoy print media. I know it's "dying", but packaging and t-shirts will likely exist for a while so I'm not all too worried at the current moment.</p>
